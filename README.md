# Data scientist / Data analyst
I’m a data scientist with a Bachelor’s degree in Communication Engineering. The background in engineering has helped me gain expertise in Mathematics, Database systems, Programming languages and Artificial intelligence. I believe in drawing insights from data and using statistical principles to make critical business decisions. I have extensive project strategy experience and can communicate well to technical and non-technical audiences. Proficient at manipulating data and applying machine learning to several domains. I have deployed models and pipelines for projects in real estate, operations and health care using Python, SQL, Git and data visualizations tools as Tableau.
